I was awarded $30,000 in funding for my research project, "[Studentsâ€™ Mobility Patterns on Campus and the Implications for the Recovery of Campus Activities Post-Pandemic](https://midas.umich.edu/project/covid19-pods-grants-nguyen-brooks-romero/)". This project was one of only 7 selected out of 49 submissions for funding through the MIDAS Propelling Original Data Science (PODS) program as part of their COVID-19 mini-grants initiative."
