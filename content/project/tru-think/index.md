TRU-Think is a pedagogy-driven AI tool designed to encourage students to think and learn in computer science education, going beyond simply providing answers.

The project was funded by the TRU Instruction Innovation Fund with a grant of $5,000 and will be integrated into computing education courses starting Fall 2025.

Key features:
- Socratic questioning approach
- Encourages critical thinking
- Supports student learning process rather than just answer provision
- Designed specifically for computer science education contexts
