I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Educational Data Science at the School of Information, University of Michigan. My research lies at the intersection of educational psychology and data science. My work focuses on exploring learning behavioral patterns of students by analysing their digital traces to understand 1) how teachers design courses in online learning environment, 2) how learning design influences student engagement, and 3) the temporal characteristics of learning behaviors and its relation to academic performance. My research employed a wide range of statistical and computational techniques, such as multilevel modelling, network analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning. My work has been published at top academic outlets such as Computers and Human Behaviors, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies and received multiple best paper awards at established conferences (LAK18 and HCI International 17). Prior to joining UM, I was a PhD candidate in Learning Analytics at The Open University UK and an Associate Lecturer in Applied Statistics at the University of Arts London. I had a background in Economics (BSc. & Msc.) at Maastricht University, Netherlands.
